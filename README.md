# casus-create-the-longest-sequence-of-1s
casus create the longest sequence of 1s  
Given some bitstring b, you may change one bit from a 0 to a 1 in order to create the longest possible sequence of consecutive 1s. Output the length of the resulting longest sequence.  
  
Example: 11011101111  
Flipping the second 0 results in 11011111111, where the longest sequence of 1s is 8 long.
